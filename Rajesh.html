<h1 style="text-align:center;color:#196F3D;">WELCOME ALL USAIN BOLT'S FANS FROM MY WEBSITE</h1>

<br/>
<p style="font-size:150%;">USAIN BOLT LIFE STORY:-</p>

   <p>Usain Bolt has been, quite simply, the face of the last three Olympic
   Games. To win the event’s blue riband event, the 100m, just once,
   guarantees Olympic immortality. To do it three times at consecutive 
   Games, and add the 200m and 4x100m relay titles to the mix, gives him
   a good case to be considered the greatest athlete of all time. Still
   only 33, he is a living legend. Add real charm and humour to the mix,
   and Bolt has been the superstar that the Games needed over the last
   decade and a bit.</p>
   
   <p>Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, Jamaica.
   He grew up as a sports-obsessed kid, excelling in football and 
   cricket. At high school, his cricket coach encouraged him to try 
   athletics seriously. It was a good decision, By the age of 16, in 
   2002, he was world junior champion.</p>
   
   <p>By 2007, he was the fastest man in history, setting his first 100m
   world record, and a year later, at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games,
   he rose to international superstardom. In China, Bolt triumphed in
   the men’s 100m sprint, and then added the 200m and 4x100m title to
   secure a legendary triple. He broke the world record in all three
   events.</p>
   
   <p>Further magic was to follow. At London 2012 he bagged the 100m again
   (beating his own Olympic record), added the 200m title, and then teamed
   up with the other Jamaican sprinters to take the 4x100m. A ‘double 
   triple’ had been secured. That became the ‘triple triple’ at Rio 2016.
   Despite entering the Games not quite looking his best, Bolt once again
   secured all three titles – 100m, 200m and 4x100m – to make history once
   more.</p> 
   
   <p>Bolt had to return his 4x100m medal for Beijing 2008 after his
   teammate Nestor Carter was retroactively banned for a doping violation,
   but his personal record remains impeccable – and his sprinting record
   haul surely unbeatable.</p>
   
   <p>Since his retirement in 2018, Bolt has remained extremely popular
   and high profile. He attempted to become a professional footballer –
   training with sides like Borussia Dortmund and Central Coast Mariners,
   as well as playing at Soccer Aid – and has got several business
   interests, including a new range of electric scooters.</p>
   
   <p>Always a hit at personal appearances – he cropped up at the 2019 
   Super Bowl, where he equalled the fastest ever 40-yard dash – it seems
   like there will be a lot more to come from Bolt. The main challenge for
   the Olympic Games over the next decade? Finding another superstar of his
   stature.</p>
